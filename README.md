# Hi, I'm Mohammad Junaid 👋  
### Data Analyst | SQL • Python • Tableau | Business-Focused Analytics

🎯 I build structured, end-to-end data analytics projects that transform raw data into clear business decisions.

I come from a Business Analytics & Research background (BBA) and focus on building production-style analytics systems using SQL, data modeling, KPI frameworks, and visualization tools.

I believe analytics is not about writing queries —  
it's about solving business problems with structured thinking.
